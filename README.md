# Composable Functinal JavaScript

This repo contains code samples from the course "Learning Composable Functional JavaScript with Professor Frisby"

I highly recommend the course material, it's pure gold: http://bit.ly/2hghpoY

## Running samples

To execute sample codes install babel npm package which brings Babel support to Node.js:
```
$ npm install --global babel
```
And then run the script thay you want:
```
$ babel-node box_0.js
```
